## What exactly is placeB?
The storage solutions at placeB should be as simple as possible. That's why we have a simple answer to every question. 

## For whom is placeB intended?
placeB is for anyone who needs space. These can be individuals as well as companies or associations.

## How big are the storage spaces?
Storage spaces (we speak in terms of placeB boxes) range in size from 1 m3 to 36 m3. There are different options depending on the location.

## What is a placeBox?
The placeBox is your private storage space. It can vary in size (from 1 to 30 m3).


## How much does a storage space cost?
It varies depending on the location, the length of the storage period and the size of the space. A placeBox (which is what we call individual storage spaces) that is 1 m3 in size starts at just CHF 39 per month.

## Are there any additional costs?
There is a security deposit, which depends on the size of the placeBox. The fee will be charged to your credit card and refunded at the end of the rental. There are no other additional costs.

## Are my belongings insured?
Not automatically. However, you must purchase insurance against theft, fire, and water damage. You have two options: either you contact your home insurance provider to add coverage with them or you insure the stored items with us. You need only check the appropriate box on your contract. The costs of insuring with us are more favorable than what you would pay on your home insurance policy. The monthly fee is CHF 6 per CHF 10,000 of goods.

## Is there a minimum or maximum rental period?
The minimum rental period is 1 week. There is no maximum period. You can enter into a permanent contract for 12 months that will be extended automatically without notice thereafter by one month periods.  The good news is that you can continue the discount rate that you secured during the first year.

## What are the cancellation periods?
There is no cancellation period. If you do not notify us of your desire to cancel, the contract will be automatically extended by one months increments. When you cancel, the contract runs until the end of the contract period. Warning: if you cancel on the last day, make sure that your placeBox is empty because you will then lose access to your placeBox.

## Can I reserve a placeBox in advance?
You can make reservations up to 1 month in advance. If you would like to make an advance reservation for a placeBox, then please call us. Together we will find a solution: phone 043 273 9191.

## What can I store in my placeBox?
Basically anything that common sense permits. You may not store poisons, explosives, otherwise dangerous items, perishable, illegal, or living things and nothing that creates an odor.

## Can I work in a placeBox?
The placeBox is basically a storage space and not a workplace. However, you can repack your items and sort them at your space. But you may not actually work in the placeBox for liability reasons.

## How can I get bulky and heavy objects from my vehicle to the placeBox?
We choose our locations so that they are as easily accessible as possible. In addition, small hand carts are available at each of our locations to transport goods.

## Will I get a key for my storage space?
No, itâ€™s not necessary. You open your placeBox and gain access to the storage space using the free placeApp.

## Are there times when the storage facilities are closed?
No. The placeApp gives you around the clock access to your placeBox.

## Can I allow third parties access to my placeBox?
Yes. The placeApp makes this easy to do. You can allow any number of people to access your space for a precisely defined period of time. These people must also install the placeApp on their cellphones, and they can use the app to access your space in accordance with the restrictions that you specified.

## Can I use several placeBoxes at various locations using the same user account?
Yes, the placeApp makes that possible.
