/**
 * A Dummy file for the Webstrom IDE so it can access a directory as a package hence get intellisense.
 * Since only a directory in "node_modeules" is auto imported by WebStorm, this is a workaround.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS NEVER LOADED BY WEBPACK AND DOES NOT GO INTO THE BUNDLE
 *
 * See open issue: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-17533
